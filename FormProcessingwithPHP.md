# Basic Form Processing with PHP

Put the files *page_design_form.html* and *display_page.php* on a web server. Make sure you can view the pages in a browser. When the user submits the form (*page_design_form.html*)  *display_page.php* should be displayed.

1. Add some PHP tags to *display_page.php*. Experiment with creating some simple variables and echoing out messages in this page.

2. Open *page_design_form.html*. Click the submit button. Make sure you understand why the browser navigates to *display_page.php*.
    + To test your understanding edit the code in *page_design_form.html* so that the University homepage is loaded instead when the submit button is clicked. Once you've got this to work, set it back to load *display_page.php*.

3. In *display_page.php* think about how you can display the data the user has entered into *page_design_form.html* i.e. if they type 'hello' into the first textbox, 'hello' should be displayed in *display_page.php*.
    + Have a look at notes on [PHP Form Processing](php-form-processing.md) for similar examples
    + If you can get this to work, display the text from the first textbox as a H1 element and the text from the second textbox as a paragraph element.

4. Add the following radio buttons to the HTML form:
```html
<fieldset>
<legend>What colour background would you like?</legend>
<label for="bg_red">Red</label><input id="bg_red" type="radio" name="bg_colour" value="red">
<label for="bg_blue">Blue</label><input id="bg_blue" type="radio" name="bg_colour" value="blue">
<label for="bg_green">Green</label><input id="bg_green" type="radio" name="bg_colour" value="green">
<label for="bg_yellow">Yellow</label><input id="bg_yellow" type="radio" name="bg_colour" value="yellow">
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>What colour text would you like?</legend>
<label for="txt_red">Red<input id="txt_red" type="radio" name="txt_colour" value="red">
<label for="txt_blue">Blue<input id="txt_red" type="radio" name="txt_colour" value="blue">
<label for="txt_green">Green<input id="txt_red" type="radio" name="txt_colour" value="green">
<label for="txt_yellow">Yellow<input id="txt_red" type="radio" name="txt_colour" value="yellow">
</fieldset>
```

+ In *display_page.php* print out the colours the user has chosen.
+ *display_page.php* already contains some CSS. Can you dynamically generate some of these CSS values so that the userâ€™s choice of colours are used in the page.

5. Add the following select menu to the HTML page.
```html
<fieldset>
<label for="font">Choose a font</label>
<select id="font" name="font">
<option value="Arial">Arial</option>
<option value="Arial">Verdana</option>
<option value="Courier">Courier</option>
<option value="Comic Sans MS">Comic Sans</option>
</select>
</fieldset>
```
+ In *display_page.php* dynamically generate the value for font-family so that the page contents are displayed in the user's choice of font.  


## More Challenging Exercises
6. Modify your copy of *display_page.php* to add some validation.
    * Make sure the user has selected different colours for the background and the text
    * Add some simple validation to determine whether or not the user has completed all the fields.
        * Use the *isset()* function for the radio buttons.
        * For the text fields investigate how the *trim()* and *empty()* functions can help see php.net (http://php.net/manual/en/function.trim.php)  
    * Do some research into the *htmlspecialchars()* function and how it can help defend against malicious code.
7. Make a 'postback' form
    * Modify your application to create a 'postback' form, where the PHP code and the HTML form are in a single file.
    * If you can get this to work, think about how you re-populate the form with the values the user has entered previously. There is an example on the notes describing how to do this for a textbox.
